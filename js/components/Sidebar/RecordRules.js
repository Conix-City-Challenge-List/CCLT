        <h3>Record Submission Requirements</h3>
        <div class="right-text">
            <p>
                You must have achieved the record without using hacks (including hacks that change the physics of the game, ie. physics bypass via MegaHack. Note that Click Between Frames is allowed but Physics Bypass is banned.).
            </p>
            <p>
                Level MUST be less than 30 seconds long. No longer. If It is longer than 30 seconds it will not be accepted on the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Completion must have clicks clearly audible in the video. (Mobile players are exempt from this rule but they should preferably have taps.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Complete raw footage is required alongside your record for any layouts in Extreme Tier or above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recording must have a previous attempt and death animation shown before the completion, unless the completion is on the first attempt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recording must show the player hit the endwall and the endscreen must be shown or the completion will be invalidated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not use secret routes, skips, or bug routes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheat Indicator is required for all completions via MegaHack, Geode, or iCreate Pro. If you do not have Cheat Indicator on, your record will likely be invalidated. (This is not 100% required for mobile as of yet due to mobile limitations).
            </p>
